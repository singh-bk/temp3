Well, reason I'm here,
one of your cons, Maurice.

358
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,787
He's most likely the culprit.

into the victim's house,

374
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:50,517
and then searches his house

375
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,918
like he knows there's something there,

376
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,720
like he's looking
for something in particular.

377
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,322

378
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,858

A Humvee in a restaurant parking lot,

- two other vehicles involved.
- Hmm.

787
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,143
So I run the plate number on the Hummer,

788
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:46,878
and it's registered to a corporation
